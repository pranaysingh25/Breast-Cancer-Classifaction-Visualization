# Breast-Cancer-Classifaction-Visualization

Built a machine learning model for Breast Cancer Classification using "Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Data Set".

I used various Machine learining models, the best accuracy was 96% with 9% log loss using Neural Networks. The NN model was created using the Keras' Sequential API.
